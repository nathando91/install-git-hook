Git Pre-Commit Hook Installer
This repository hosts a script designed to automate the installation of a pre-commit hook for Git projects. The pre-commit hook script included within ensures that Git local user configuration is set before allowing commits. This is crucial for maintaining security and compliance with project-specific user information requirements.

Purpose
The pre-commit hook aims to:

Verify that Git local user information (name and email) is configured for each project.
Promote best practices for security by discouraging the use of global Git user information across all projects.
Provide an easy and automated way to ensure that commits meet the project's compliance and security standards.
Features
Automated Installation: A simple command allows the pre-commit hook to be installed into any local Git repository.
User Verification: Before each commit, the script checks if the local Git user information is set, promoting project-specific configurations.
Flexibility: Offers guidance on how to configure local user information if not already set, with options for using global settings or entering new information.
How to Install
To install the pre-commit hook in your local Git repository, run the following command:

bash
Copy code
curl -Ls https://github.com/nathando91/install-git-hook/blob/main/install-script.sh | sh
This command downloads and executes the installation script, which automatically places the pre-commit hook into your .git/hooks directory.

Usage
Once installed, the pre-commit hook automatically runs each time git commit is executed. If your local user information is not configured, the hook will halt the commit process and provide instructions for setting up your Git user information locally.

Contributing
We welcome contributions to improve the installation script or the pre-commit hook functionality. Please feel free to fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.
